#DH 5000
## Agenda for Oct 6 How we got here; 'code'

+ Seminar presentation by Jenna (cf [instructions](http://dhcu.ca/2015/what-is-a-seminar)):
  + Eric Steven Raymond, 'The Cathedral & the Bazaar' http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/
  + Susan Hockey, "The History of Humanities Computing" in A Companion to Digital Humanities, ed. Susan Schreibman, Ray Siemens, John Unsworth. Oxford: Blackwell, 2004. http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/
  + Paul Ford, ‘What is Code?’ http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/

+ Break
+ tool tutorial
  + fork the tool tutorial template
  + feel free to write / explore / think in groups, up to 3.
  + choose from the available options:
    - Visualizing Github repositories history: http://ghv.artzub.com/
    - Gource: http://gource.io/
    - Git: https://git-scm.com/
    - Github: http://github.com
    - Pandoc: http://pandoc.org/  (see also the [sept 29 agenda](sept-29.md) for a critical note on using pandoc)
    - nvAlt: http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/
    
    In your tool tutorial, be sure to think about what this particular tool would do to your research process, or to the process of scholarship more generally. Think also on the fact that none of these things were developed with folks like us in mind...
    
    The first two give a way of visualizing that 'citation' history, that trail of development, that underpins code. The next two are of course the tools that we use to a. keep track and b. collaborate and share. Finally, 'Pandoc' allows for us to translate those simple .md files into other formats as needs arise. nvAlt is a flat note-taking / personal wiki-kind-of-thing, that saves each note as a simple txt file: which can then sync & share across various places. (I even had a student who wrote his thesis using it once, and you read it there too, so that you had a non-linear and emergent approach to his work, but that's another story).

Notes:

Raymond (2000): Reflections
-	What can be produced from the perspective and work of many
-	How can cultural anthropologists make the most of collaborative DH tools or chose the best ones based on what they want to do?
-	mapped his changes and updates-public transperancy implications,

- William Mcartney- humanist, anglocentric nature of DH, Melissa Terrace 
- Global subversion of DH via code- depends on internet and computer access- how does that happen?
